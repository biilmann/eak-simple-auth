# EAK Simple Auth

An example of using [Ember-Simple-Auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth) with the
[Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit).

This example will NOT work without a companion API server.


You can use our [Rails/Devise/Doorkeeper companion server](https://github.com/digitalplaywright/rails-token-auth),
**or any other oauth API server of your choice**.

## Getting Started

Follow the [Ember App Kit Getting Started Guide](http://iamstef.net/ember-app-kit/guides/getting-started.html) to setup and run this api client.
